# AI_Subjective_Answer_Evaluation
The current method of evaluating subjective
papers is an exhaustive and time-consuming
process. Most mass scale examinations are
forced to be MCQ based because of ease of
evaluation. Online exams are mostly MCQ based
because of ease and accuracy of evaluation on a
mass scale. Subjective answers are much better
in evaluating a student’s knowledge in certain
subjects as they require detailed description.
The manual system for evaluation of Subjective
Answers for subjects involves a lot of time and
effort of the evaluator. If this task can be done
by an AI application, it can decrease burden of
the teachers significantly.

My AI model takes in a standard answer and the
student’s answer and evaluates the answers
based on the similarity between the two
answers. There is also a spell check algorithm to
reduce marks for wrong spellings. There is also
an option for looking for important keywords.
The AI model works with Google Forms (a
common evaluation platform), to automatically
evaluate the responses from the form. The
standard answers are given by the teacher. After
evaluation it also provides important statistics
on the performance of the students on the
subjective answers
